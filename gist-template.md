/Regex?/

What is Regex? Is a sequence of chracters that search for specific pattern in a text. It looks for a combination of strings in a search bar. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. 
## Summary

The Regex I'm going to be describing is an Anchor which is using the caret symbol followed by a meta char single character lowercase "/d" which is any number from 0-9 and lowercase "/w" which is any letter from A-Z or a-z. The caret Anchor does not match any character, instead they match a position before a characters. There are different anchor that can be used such as, the dollar symbol. The dollar symbol will match characters before the final line break or at the very end of the string.
