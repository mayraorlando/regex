# Title 
/Regex?/

What is Regex? Is a sequence of chracters that search for specific pattern in a text. It looks for a combination of strings in a search bar. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. 
## Summary

The Regex I'm going to be decribing is Quantifiers which indicates numbers and characters or expressions to match.
